# chef-docs

The source of the Chef documentation, located at https://docs.chef.io/

THIS REPO IS DEPRECATED FOR ACTIVE DOCUMENTATION MAINTENANCE. Please see https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs.

What happened? Chef refactored the chef-docs repo to remove the commit history so that our continuously delivered documentation builds faster. This means that:

https://github.com/chef/chef-docs redirects to

https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs-2016

but really, the https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs repo is the one we're using to build the documentation. Which means that https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs is the repo against which issues or pull requests should be submitted.

Thanks for your continued contributions to the documentation for Chef!
